# ANTCipher - Advanced Numerical Techniques Cipher

**Introduction**:
We have disigned a 32-bit-block encryption cipher to mask confidential content, optimized for 32 bit intel x86 platforms.

**Features**:
1. Code is written in C for optimal performance
2. Used Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) for encryption, which adds an extra layer of security to the encrypted data
3. Implemented Data Encryption Standard for comply with global security protocols
4. Included multiple rounds of substitution to include more randomness into the system.
5. Differential Matrix Analysis
